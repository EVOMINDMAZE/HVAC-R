# A2L Leak Detection Guide

A2L refrigerants (mildly flammable) require special safety considerations. This guide covers best practices for using our A2L leak detection calculator.

## What Are A2L Refrigerants?

A2L refrigerants have low toxicity and mild flammability. Common examples include:
- **R-32**: Used in mini-splits and heat pumps
- **R-454B**: Drop-in replacement for R-410A
- **R-1234yf**: Common in automotive applications

## Safety Requirements

### Maximum Charge Limits
The calculator determines safe charge limits based on:
- Room volume (length × width × height)
- Refrigerant Lower Flammability Limit (LFL)
- Required safety factor (typically 25% of LFL)

### Formula Used
```
Max Charge (kg) = Room Volume (m³) × LFL (kg/m³) × Safety Factor
```

## Using the Calculator

1. Enter room dimensions (length, width, height)
2. Select your A2L refrigerant type
3. Choose the safety standard (ASHRAE 15, IEC 60335-2-40)
4. Calculator displays:
   - Maximum safe charge
   - Recommended detector placement
   - Ventilation requirements

## Best Practices

- **Always ventilate** when working with A2L refrigerants
- **Use approved leak detectors** rated for A2L compounds
- **Check local codes** - some jurisdictions have additional requirements
- **Document all charges** for compliance records

## Emergency Response

If a significant leak is detected:
1. Evacuate the area immediately
2. Ventilate the space
3. Eliminate all ignition sources
4. Do not re-enter until gas concentration drops below LFL
