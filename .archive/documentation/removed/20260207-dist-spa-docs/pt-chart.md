# PT Chart Reference

Pressure-Temperature (PT) charts are essential tools for HVAC diagnostics. This guide explains how to use them effectively.

## What is a PT Chart?

A PT chart shows the relationship between refrigerant pressure and saturation temperature. At any given pressure, the chart tells you the temperature at which the refrigerant boils (evaporates) or condenses.

## Using PT Charts

### Finding Saturation Temperature from Pressure
1. Measure the pressure using your gauges
2. Locate that pressure on the chart for your refrigerant
3. Read across to find the saturation temperature

### Finding Pressure from Temperature
1. Measure the temperature using a thermometer
2. Locate that temperature on the chart
3. Read across to find the corresponding pressure

## Application Examples

### Superheat Calculation
1. Measure suction pressure (e.g., 118 psig R-410A)
2. Find saturation temp from PT chart (45°F)
3. Measure suction line temp (55°F)
4. Calculate: 55°F - 45°F = **10°F superheat**

### Subcooling Calculation
1. Measure liquid line pressure (e.g., 350 psig R-410A)
2. Find saturation temp from PT chart (100°F)
3. Measure liquid line temp (90°F)
4. Calculate: 100°F - 90°F = **10°F subcooling**

## Refrigerant Blends

For zeotropic blends (with temperature glide), you'll see two temperatures:
- **Bubble point**: Temperature where liquid starts to boil (use for subcooling)
- **Dew point**: Temperature where vapor starts to condense (use for superheat)

## Quick Access

Our subcooling and superheat calculators include built-in PT chart lookups. Simply select your refrigerant and enter the pressure—no manual chart reading required!
