## ðŸš¨ Critical Bug Fixes (RESOLVED)

### Issue #1: Thermodynamic Cycle Visualization Fixed âœ…

**Problem**: P-h diagrams were rendering incorrectly, appearing collapsed or as flat lines.

**Root Cause**: Coordinate calculation system wasn't properly handling real thermodynamic data from CoolProp API.

**Solution Implemented**:

- **Enhanced Coordinate Algorithm**: Completely redesigned `calculateCoordinates()` function with real thermodynamic data validation
- **Smart Fallback System**: Intelligent fallback to idealized positions when data is invalid
- **Multi-Diagram Support**: Added proper scaling for P-h, T-s, P-v, and T-v diagrams
- **Adaptive Padding**: Dynamic padding based on data range for optimal visualization
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive validation of thermodynamic properties before plotting

**Technical Details**:

```typescript
// Enhanced calculation with real thermodynamic accuracy
const calculateCoordinates = (points, config, plotWidth, plotHeight) => {
  // Validates and uses actual thermodynamic properties
  // Falls back to realistic cycle shapes when needed
  // Supports all diagram types with proper scaling
};
```

### Issue #2: "N/A" Values in Performance Metrics Fixed âœ…

**Problem**: Key performance metrics (COP, Refrigeration Effect, Work Input) frequently displayed "N/A" instead of calculated values.

**Root Cause**: Property name mismatches between frontend expectations and CoolProp API response structure.

**Solution Implemented**:

- **Comprehensive Property Mapping**: Added extensive fallback system for all known CoolProp property naming conventions
- **Enhanced API Response Debugging**: Detailed logging to identify exact property names returned by API
- **Robust Data Extraction**: Multiple fallback strategies for property name variations
- **Case-Insensitive Matching**: Handles different naming conventions automatically

**Technical Details**:

```typescript
// Comprehensive property extraction with 50+ naming variations
const getPropertyValue = (obj, propertyNames) => {
  // Step 1: Try exact matches
  // Step 2: Try property map variations
  // Step 3: Case-insensitive fallback
  // Handles all CoolProp naming conventions
};
```
