# n8n Member Server Templates

This directory contains configuration files for deploying **individual n8n instances** for "Business in a Box" members.

**IMPORTANT:**
- These files are for Member infrastructure only.
- The Core HVAC-R App **DOES NOT** use Docker or local databases. It runs exclusively on Supabase Cloud.
- Do not use `docker-compose.yml` to run the main application.
