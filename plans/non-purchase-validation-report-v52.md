# Non-Purchase Validation Report V52 (Proxy Sessions)

Note: This report uses 5 proxy sessions (internal role-play walkthroughs), not external customer interviews.

## Sample Mix
- Owner/Manager (2)
- Technician/Lead Tech (2)
- Entrepreneur/New Shop (1)

## Findings by Proxy Session

### 1) Owner/Manager A
- First 3-5s read: understands "one system for jobs + compliance + engineering."
- Primary objection: wants stronger operations proof over engineering proof in first screen.
- CTA choice: `Book Ops Demo`.
- Requested proof: explicit mention of dispatch queue + closeout timeline with compliance export.

### 2) Owner/Manager B
- First 3-5s read: clear product category and audience.
- Primary objection: asks "how quickly my current process migrates."
- CTA choice: `Book Ops Demo`.
- Requested proof: onboarding timeline and "what setup is required."

### 3) Technician/Lead Tech A
- First 3-5s read: sees value but wants faster route to diagnostics tools.
- Primary objection: field workflow still feels office-first in the hero.
- CTA choice: `Start Free`.
- Requested proof: one quick "symptom -> diagnose -> report" visual with tool names.

### 4) Technician/Lead Tech B
- First 3-5s read: understands hybrid ops/engineering.
- Primary objection: uncertainty around mobile jobsite usage quality.
- CTA choice: `Start Free`.
- Requested proof: mobile screenshot row focused on troubleshooting and active job.

### 5) Entrepreneur/New Shop
- First 3-5s read: clear free-start path.
- Primary objection: confusion on when to upgrade from engineering to ops.
- CTA choice: `Start Free`.
- Requested proof: one-line upgrade trigger matrix by monthly jobs/team size.

## Objection Buckets
- Clarity: medium (upgrade trigger still not explicit enough).
- Trust/Compliance: low-medium (needs one stronger EPA workflow callout near pricing).
- Feature overload: low (improved from prior version).
- Pricing transition: medium-high (most repeated concern).

## Top 3 Iteration Targets (V53)
1) Add an explicit upgrade trigger strip in pricing:
   - Example: "Move to Business Ops when you manage 2+ crews or need audit-ready workflow records per job."
2) Add a migration/setup micro-block near hero:
   - Example: "Start in one day. Bring active jobs first, then clients and templates."
3) Add mobile field-proof module row above fold on mobile:
   - `Field Jobs`, `Troubleshooting`, `Compliance Log` snapshot chips.

## Decision
- Keep current CTA pair (`Start Free`, `Book Ops Demo`).
- Keep current pillar model.
- Prioritize pricing transition clarity and setup proof in next iteration.

## Implementation Status
- Applied in landing iteration:
  - setup/migration proof block in hero
  - explicit upgrade trigger phrasing in pricing narrative
  - mobile field-proof chips above fold
- External buyer interviews still recommended before final lock.
