# Understanding Results

After a calculation completes, the results panel shows several key metrics.

Core metrics
- COP (Coefficient of Performance): ratio of useful cooling to compressor work.
- Capacity: cooling capacity typically in kW.
- Compressor Work: power input to the compressor.
- Mass Flow: refrigerant mass flow rate.

Cycle state points
- Evaporator outlet (compressor inlet) — superheat corrected conditions.
- Compressor discharge (condenser inlet) — after compression.
- Condenser outlet — subcooled liquid.

Diagnostics
- Check if compressor discharge temperature is exceptionally high — may indicate mismatch.
- Low COP might indicate high condensing temperature or excessive pressure drop.

Use the visualization and table exports to compare runs and optimize operating conditions.
