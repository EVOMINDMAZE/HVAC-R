# First Calculation

This guide walks through creating your first Standard Cycle calculation.

1. Navigate to Standard Cycle.
2. Choose a refrigerant (e.g., R134a).
3. Fill in the following fields:
   - Evaporator temperature (째C)
   - Condenser temperature (째C)
   - Superheat (째C)
   - Subcooling (째C)
4. Click "Calculate".

Understanding the output
- COP: Coefficient of Performance.
- Cooling capacity: Device cooling power (kW or similar).
- Mass flow: Refrigerant mass flow rate.
- State points: Pressure/temperature points for evaporator, condenser, compressor inlet/outlet.
