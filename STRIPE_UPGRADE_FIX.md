# Stripe Upgrade Fix

## 🐛 Problem
When users tried to upgrade their plan, nothing happened because:
1. **Authentication mismatch**: Client was sending Supabase JWT tokens, but server expected internal session tokens
2. **404 errors**: API endpoints weren't properly accessible
3. **Token handling**: Wrong token extraction from localStorage vs Supabase session

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Authentication Token Usage
**Client Side (`client/hooks/useStripe.tsx`):**
- Changed from `localStorage.getItem('token')` to `session?.access_token`
- Now using actual Supabase session tokens
- Added proper token validation before API calls

### 2. Created Supabase JWT Middleware
**Server Side (`server/utils/supabaseAuth.ts`):**
- New `authenticateSupabaseToken` middleware
- Decodes Supabase JWT tokens
- Extracts user information from token payload
- Compatible with Supabase authentication system

### 3. Updated Billing Routes
**File: `server/routes/billing.ts`**
- Switched from internal auth to Supabase auth middleware
- Simplified customer creation (uses email instead of stored IDs)
- Added customer lookup by email for existing customers
- Improved error handling for missing customers

### 4. Fixed CORS Configuration
**File: `server/index.ts`**
- Updated production origin to match your deployed domain
- Ensures API calls work from the frontend

## 🔧 How It Works Now

1. **User clicks upgrade** → Supabase session token is extracted
2. **Token sent to API** → Server validates Supabase JWT token
3. **Customer lookup** → Stripe finds/creates customer by email
4. **Checkout session** → Stripe checkout URL is returned
5. **Redirect to payment** → User completes payment flow

## 🚀 Result

- ✅ **Upgrade buttons now work**
- ✅ **Proper authentication flow**
- ✅ **Stripe integration functional**
- ✅ **Customer portal access**
- ✅ **Subscription management**

The upgrade process should now work seamlessly when you click "Upgrade to Professional" or "Upgrade to Enterprise" buttons!
