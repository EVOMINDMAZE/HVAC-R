# Developer Guide

This documentation has moved to the consolidated skills directory.

**Please refer to the [Developer Guide](./skills/03_development/developer_guide.md) for the latest documentation.**

## Why was this moved?

The ThermoNeural project uses a skills-based documentation architecture where all technical documentation is organized in the `skills/` directory. This ensures:

1. **Single Source of Truth** - All documentation lives in one structured location
2. **Template Compliance** - All skills follow the standardized YAML frontmatter format
3. **Better Navigation** - The [skills/README.md](./skills/README.md) provides a comprehensive directory index
