## **Comprehensive Retrospective Analysis Plan**

### **Objective**
Produce a detailed technical report documenting the entire HVAC-R application development lifecycle from inception to current state, including:
- Architecture decisions and rationale
- Completed features and functionality
- Partially implemented components
- Integration points and external services
- Testing coverage and quality assurance
- Technical debt and architectural constraints
- Structured development roadmap with priorities, effort estimates, and dependencies

### **Research Methodology**
1. **Architecture Analysis**
   - Review tech stack from `package.json` and configuration files
   - Examine database schema via Supabase migrations
   - Analyze authentication and RBAC implementation
   - Evaluate multi-tenancy design and security model

2. **Feature Inventory**
   - Catalog all pages and components from `client/App.tsx` routing
   - Review custom hooks for business logic implementation
   - Examine server routes and edge functions for backend capabilities
   - Assess AI/ML features and pattern recognition systems

3. **Integration Assessment**
   - Map external service integrations (Stripe, Resend, Telnyx, Open-Meteo, Sanity)
   - Evaluate IoT/smart home connectivity implementation
   - Review automation workflows and edge functions

4. **Testing & Quality Analysis**
   - Analyze unit test coverage from `vitest` results
   - Review e2e test suites and playwright configurations
   - Assess production readiness from existing documentation

5. **Technical Debt Identification**
   - Scan for TODO/FIXME comments and incomplete implementations
   - Evaluate code organization and maintainability
   - Assess database migration complexity and RLS policy challenges

### **Report Structure**
1. **Executive Summary** - Project status and strategic positioning
2. **Architecture Overview** - Tech stack, design patterns, key decisions
3. **Feature Completion Matrix** - Completed, partially implemented, pending features
4. **Integration Ecosystem** - External services and data flows
5. **Testing & Quality Assurance** - Coverage, gaps, automation maturity
6. **Technical Debt Analysis** - Code quality, performance, security considerations
7. **Development Roadmap** - Priority classification, effort estimates, dependencies
8. **Critical Path Analysis** - Blockers and MVP readiness assessment
9. **Recommendations** - Immediate actions and strategic next steps

### **Deliverables**
- **Comprehensive Technical Report** (Markdown format)
- **Feature Completion Dashboard** (Visual status matrix)
- **Development Roadmap** (Prioritized task list with estimates)
- **Architecture Decision Record** (Key technical choices documented)
- **Technical Debt Register** (Actionable remediation items)

### **Time Estimate**
- Research & Analysis: 2-3 hours
- Report Compilation: 1-2 hours
- Review & Refinement: 1 hour

### **Success Criteria**
- Clear visibility into project progress for stakeholders
- Actionable roadmap for achieving MVP/production readiness
- Identification of critical path items and dependencies
- Documentation of architectural decisions for future reference
