I will conduct a comprehensive automated test of the application by simulating different user roles (Admin, Manager, Technician, Client) to verify their access rights and workflows.

### Plan Details

1.  **Start Development Server**:
    *   Launch `npm run dev` to get the application running on port 8080.

2.  **Create Test Scenarios Script**:
    *   I will create a robust testing script `scripts/test_user_scenarios.ts` using the Supabase client directly (since I can't browse visually) to simulate the following personas:
        *   **Admin User**:
            *   Can invite new team members (`/api/team/invite`).
            *   Can update roles (`/api/team/role`).
            *   Can view all fleet data (`/api/fleet/status`).
            *   Can manage billing.
        *   **Manager User**:
            *   Can invite technicians.
            *   Can view fleet status.
            *   *Cannot* invite/promote admins (Access Control Check).
        *   **Technician User**:
            *   Can view their assigned jobs.
            *   Can perform calculations.
            *   *Cannot* invite members or change roles (Access Control Check).
        *   **Client User**:
            *   Can view their specific project/job status (if implemented).
            *   *Cannot* access internal fleet/team data.

3.  **Execute & Analyze**:
    *   Run the test script.
    *   The script will authenticate as each user type (creating temp users if needed or using existing test accounts) and hit the relevant API endpoints.
    *   It will assert that 200 OK is returned for allowed actions and 403 Forbidden is returned for restricted actions.

4.  **Report Findings**:
    *   I will output a summary of the test results, highlighting any permission gaps or broken flows.
    *   I will also provide the `OpenPreview` link so you can explore manually in parallel.

### Verification
*   The script's output will serve as verification of the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation.
