The user has explicitly requested to interact with Supabase via the **Supabase CLI**. This is a viable path since `npx supabase` commands (like `db push` or `migration up`) might work if the CLI is authenticated and configured correctly, bypassing the direct DNS resolution issues faced by the Node.js `pg` client.

### Plan:

1.  **Check Supabase CLI Status:**
    *   Verify if `npx supabase projects list` works (requires login).
    *   If not logged in, I will ask the user to run `npx supabase login`.

2.  **Link the Project (if needed):**
    *   The project ID is `rxqflxmzsqhqrzffcsej` (from `.env`).
    *   Run `npx supabase link --project-ref rxqflxmzsqhqrzffcsej`.
    *   *Note:* This might require the database password. I see `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD='TddR7OpEdrkbbwOE'` in the `.env` file.

3.  **Push the Migration:**
    *   Once linked, run `npx supabase db push`.
    *   This will apply the pending migration files (including the fix `20260206000005_fix_rpc_bugs.sql`) to the remote database.

4.  **Verify:**
    *   Re-run `npx tsx scripts/test_browser_scenarios.ts` to confirm the fix works.

### Why this might work better than `pg` script:
The Supabase CLI often uses the Transaction API (via HTTPS) or tunnels for migrations, which might bypass the local DNS resolution issue that blocked the `pg` connection string method.
