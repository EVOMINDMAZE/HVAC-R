## Production Readiness Final Phase - Next Steps

After completing architecture documentation updates, the following tasks are required for final production deployment:

### Phase 1: Testing & Validation
1. **Write comprehensive tests for privacy features** - Unit tests for ConsentBanner, Privacy API routes, and consent recording logic
2. **Test auth integration in Supabase production environment** - Validate authentication flows with real Supabase instance
3. **Run full E2E test suite** - Execute Playwright tests after fixing server port configuration (3001 vs 5173)
4. **Security penetration testing** - Focus on new privacy endpoints for GDPR/CCPA compliance validation

### Phase 2: Performance & Monitoring
5. **Performance testing of privacy features** - Ensure consent management doesn't impact application performance
6. **Set up monitoring for compliance features** - Create alerts for consent recording failures and DSR request processing
7. **Load test privacy APIs** - Verify they can handle concurrent user consent requests

### Phase 3: Deployment Preparation
8. **Update deployment documentation** - Incorporate new migration approach (consolidated baseline) and privacy requirements
9. **Create production environment checklist** - Final verification of all environment variables and configurations
10. **Prepare rollback procedures** - Document steps to revert privacy features if needed

### Phase 4: Final Verification
11. **Verify encryption at rest and in transit** - Confirm AES-256 and TLS 1.3 are properly implemented
12. **Validate SOC 2 compliance evidence** - Ensure all required documentation and controls are in place
13. **Conduct final security audit** - Review all new code for security vulnerabilities

### Phase 5: Launch & Monitoring
14. **Deploy to staging environment** - Test in staging with production-like configuration
15. **Monitor initial production rollout** - Track consent acceptance rates and DSR request volumes
16. **Create post-deployment validation checklist** - Verify all privacy features are functioning correctly

Each phase builds on the previous work to ensure the platform is fully production-ready with comprehensive privacy compliance.
