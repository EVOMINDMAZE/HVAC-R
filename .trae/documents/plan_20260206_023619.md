# Live Visual Verification of 9 User Scenarios

## 📋 Objectives
Perform a "live-like" navigation of the 9 scenarios. Since I operate in a remote environment, I will use **Playwright Automation** to act as a real user, navigating through the pages, clicking buttons, and filling forms. To ensure you can see the results, I will capture **Visual Proof (Screenshots)** for every single step and provide you with a **Live Preview URL** to explore the app yourself.

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: Database & Credential Setup (The "Source of Truth")
1.  **Sync Credentials**: I will update the database to use the exact passwords you provided (`ThermoAdmin$2026!`, `DemoManager123!`, etc.) using the `scripts/create_test_users.ts` tool.
2.  **Verify Access**: I'll perform a quick backend check to ensure these credentials are live in the cloud Supabase project.

### Phase 2: "Real User" Automation with Visual Proof
1.  **Develop Automation**: I will write a Playwright script `e2e/live_navigation_verification.spec.ts` that:
    - **Simulates a Real User**: It won't just check the code; it will literally "open" the browser, "click" the login button, "navigate" to settings, and "interact" with the UI.
    - **Captures Every Step**: I will configure it to save a screenshot for **every major step** (e.g., `step1_login_success.png`, `step2_company_selected.png`, `step3_invite_generated.png`).
2.  **Run the Simulation**: I will start the development server and run this automation.
3.  **Visual Reporting**: I will list every screenshot taken so you can open them in the IDE to see exactly what happened on the screen.

### Phase 3: Live Preview & Handoff
1.  **Provide Live Link**: I will use the `OpenPreview` tool to give you a clickable URL to the running app (`http://localhost:3001`). You can use the credentials I've verified to log in and follow along.
2.  **Final Pass/Fail Report**: I will provide a summary of the 9 scenarios, confirming which parts of the UI were successfully verified.

## 🏁 Milestone
- [ ] Database credentials synchronized.
- [ ] Playwright "Real User" script executed.
- [ ] Screenshots of all 9 scenarios saved to the workspace for your review.
- [ ] Live Preview URL provided for your own manual exploration.

Does this "Visual Proof + Live Preview" approach work for you? It's the closest way to experience real user navigation in this environment. I'm ready to start Phase 1.
