I cannot retrieve the plaintext passwords from the database because Supabase (like all secure authentication systems) stores passwords as **hashes**, not in plain text.

### Plan Details
1.  **Explanation**: I will explain that retrieving passwords directly is impossible due to security hashing.
2.  **Solution**: I will **reset** the passwords for these specific test users to a known value (`Password123!`) using the admin API. This ensures you can log in with the credentials I provide.
3.  **Execute**: I will run the `scripts/create_test_users.ts` script (after updating the code to use `Password123!` for everyone) which uses `updateUserById` or `createUser` to enforce the password.

### Verification
*   After running the script, I will confirm that the passwords have been reset to `Password123!`.
