I will refine the redesign to embody a **"Futuristic AI for HVAC"** aesthetic—sleek, modern, and tech-forward, while keeping it simple and usable.

### 1. **Visual Theme: "Neural Tech" Aesthetic**
   - **Color Palette**: Deep midnight blues/slate backgrounds with electric orange and cyan accents (echoing "thermal" and "neural").
   - **Background**:
     - **Marketing Side**: A "Neural Network" inspired background using subtle CSS animations (glowing nodes or a digital mesh) to visually represent the "AI" aspect.
     - **Form Side**: Clean, deep dark mode with glassmorphism (frosted glass) panels.
   - **Typography**:
     - Use a technical/monospace font for the "Invite Code" input to give it a "command terminal" feel.
     - Clean sans-serif for the marketing copy.

### 2. **Key UI Elements**
   - **The "AI" Input Field**:
     - The invite code input will resemble a secure data entry terminal: larger, monospace text, and a glowing border when active.
     - **Animation**: Instead of a standard spinner, use a "System Scanning..." or "Verifying Credentials..." animation effect during validation to reinforce the AI theme.
   - **HUD-Style Feedback**:
     - Success/Error messages will look like heads-up display (HUD) notifications (e.g., "ACCESS GRANTED" or "INVALID CREDENTIALS") with crisp borders and tech-inspired icons.

### 3. **Layout & Structure**
   - **Split Screen (Desktop)**:
     - **Left**: The "Neural Core" – Branding + animated network visuals.
     - **Right**: The "Control Panel" – The interface for joining the company.
   - **Mobile**:
     - A sleek, centered card floating over the neural background.

This design moves away from a standard "SaaS" look to a specialized "AI Tool" look, making the user feel like they are logging into a sophisticated system.
