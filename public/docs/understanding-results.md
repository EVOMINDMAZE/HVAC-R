# Understanding Results

This guide explains common outputs from the standard cycle calculation and how to interpret them.

## Key Outputs

- Capacity: Cooling capacity (kW) delivered by the evaporator.
- COP: Coefficient of performance — ratio of cooling provided to power input.
- Mass flow: Refrigerant mass flow rate through the cycle.
- Compressor work: Power required by the compressor.
- State points: Thermodynamic states at key locations (inlet/outlet of evaporator/condenser).

## How to interpret

- COP decreases as condensing temperature increases — lower condensing temperatures improve efficiency.
- Large superheat may indicate insufficient evaporator surface area or low refrigerant charge.
- Subcooling helps prevent flash at the expansion device and can improve capacity.
