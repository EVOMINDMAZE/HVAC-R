# Refrigerant Comparison

Use this guide to compare refrigerant options across thermodynamic performance and environmental impact.

## Methodology

- Run standard cycle calculations for each refrigerant at identical evaporator and condenser boundary conditions.
- Compare COP, capacity, mass flow, and compressor work to evaluate performance.

## Environmental Considerations

- Consider Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP) alongside performance.
- Regulatory and safety constraints (e.g., flammability) must also factor into refrigerant selection.

## Best Practices

- Favor refrigerants that meet local regulations and minimize environmental impact while delivering acceptable efficiency.
- Be prepared to adapt system components (heat exchangers, compressors) if switching to significantly different refrigerants.
