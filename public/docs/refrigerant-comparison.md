# Refrigerant Comparison

Compare refrigerants across performance, safety, and environmental metrics.

## Methodology
- Run standard cycle calculations for each refrigerant at the same evaporator and condenser temperatures.
- Compare COP, capacity, mass flow, and discharge temperatures.

## Environmental Considerations
- Global Warming Potential (GWP) and Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP) must be considered.
- Flammability and toxicity ratings impact system design and safety requirements.

## Performance Analysis
- Some low-GWP refrigerants may require design changes (larger heat exchangers, different compressors).
- Use the Refrigerant Comparison API to batch-compare multiple refrigerants.

## Best Practices
- Favor refrigerants that meet local regulations and safety codes.
- Validate performance via lab or field tests after simulation.
