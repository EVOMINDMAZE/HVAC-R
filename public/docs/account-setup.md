# Account Setup

Welcome to Simulateon — this guide helps you create and configure your account so you can start running refrigeration and HVAC&R calculations quickly.

## Creating an account

- Visit `/signup` and provide your name, email, and a secure password.
- Verify your email address if email confirmation is enabled — this activates secured features like billing and API access.

## Profile

- Open `/profile` to update your personal details: name, company, and contact information.
- Upload a profile photo (optional) to help teammates recognize you.
- Configure notification preferences and time zone for consistent timestamps.

## Billing & Subscriptions

- Visit `/pricing` to review available plans and features.
- Upgrade or downgrade plans from your Profile → Manage Billing (this opens the Stripe customer portal).
- Team and enterprise features (user management, SSO) are available on higher-tier plans.

## Access & Permissions

- Users inherit permissions based on their role and subscription tier. Enterprise accounts can manage teams and roles.
- For SSO or custom provisioning, contact support to enable enterprise integrations.

## Support

If you need help with account setup or billing, contact support@simulateon.com with your account email and a brief description of the issue.
