# Cascade Systems

Two-stage (cascade) refrigeration systems allow very low evaporator temperatures by staging compression.

## Cascade Theory
- Low-temperature (LT) cycle provides the cold stage; high-temperature (HT) cycle rejects heat to ambient.
- Cascade heat exchanger connects LT condenser to HT evaporator; delta-T is critical.

## System Design
- Choose refrigerants optimized for each stage (e.g., R744 for LT, R134a for HT).
- Design cascade HX with sufficient area and low pressure drop.

## Optimization
- Balance condenser and evaporator loads.
- Minimize cascade HX delta-T to improve LT performance while respecting approach temperature limits.

## Troubleshooting
- If LT performance is poor, check HT condensing conditions and cascade HX fouling.
- Verify proper charge distribution between stages.
