# Cascade Systems

A concise guide to designing and analyzing cascade refrigeration systems.

## Cascade Theory

- A cascade uses two (or more) cycles: a low-temperature (LT) cycle for the cold stage and a high-temperature (HT) cycle to reject heat to ambient.

## System Design

- Choose refrigerants optimized for each stage (e.g., R744 for LT, R134a for HT) and balance heat exchanger sizing.
- Ensure proper control strategy for cascade heat exchanger delta-T and compressor staging.

## Optimization

- Balance condenser and evaporator loads for best system efficiency.
- Validate operating windows across expected ambient and load ranges.

## Troubleshooting

- If LT performance is poor, check HT condensing conditions and cascade HX cleanliness.
