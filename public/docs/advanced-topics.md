# Advanced Topics

This section covers advanced features and workflows for power users.

## Custom Properties

You can define custom refrigerant property sets for proprietary fluids — these are advanced features and typically require engineering validation.

## Batch Processing

For large-scale studies, calculations can be executed repeatedly or multiple refrigerants can be processed in parallel using the comparison tool.

## Data Export

- Export CSV for numerical analysis and PDF for report-ready outputs.
- Keep units consistent across exports (e.g., temperatures in °C, pressures in kPa).

## Data Integration

Exported data can be integrated into your analytics pipelines or other engineering tools for further processing.

## Tips

- Validate inputs before running calculations to avoid errors.
- Use sensible tolerances for numerical comparisons and store raw results for reproducibility.
