# Superheat & Subcooling Calculator Guide

Accurate superheat and subcooling measurements are essential for proper refrigerant charging. This guide explains how to use our calculators effectively.

## Understanding Superheat

**Superheat** is the temperature increase of refrigerant vapor above its saturation temperature at the evaporator outlet.

### How to Calculate
1. Measure suction line temperature
2. Measure suction pressure
3. Look up saturation temperature from PT chart
4. Subtract saturation temp from actual temp

**Formula**: `Superheat = Suction Line Temp - Saturation Temp`

### Target Values
- Fixed orifice systems: 10-15°F
- TXV systems: 8-12°F

## Understanding Subcooling

**Subcooling** is the temperature decrease of liquid refrigerant below its saturation temperature at the condenser outlet.

### How to Calculate
1. Measure liquid line temperature
2. Measure liquid line (high side) pressure
3. Look up saturation temperature from PT chart
4. Subtract actual temp from saturation temp

**Formula**: `Subcooling = Saturation Temp - Liquid Line Temp`

### Target Values
- Typical systems: 10-18°F (check manufacturer specs)
- Higher subcooling may indicate overcharge
- Lower subcooling may indicate undercharge or restriction

## Using the Calculator

1. Select the refrigerant type
2. Enter your pressure readings
3. Enter your temperature readings
4. The calculator will display superheat/subcooling values
5. Compare to target values for diagnosis
