# First Calculation

This walkthrough helps you run your first standard cycle calculation and interpret the output.

## Steps

1. Navigate to the Standard Cycle page.
2. Select a refrigerant (e.g., R134a) and enter boundary conditions:
   - Evaporator temperature: e.g., -10 째C
   - Condensing temperature: e.g., 45 째C
   - Superheat: 5 째C
   - Subcooling: 2 째C
3. Click `Calculate` and wait for the results.

## Interpreting the results

- Review COP, capacity, and compressor work.
- Open the Cycle Visualization to see T-s and P-h diagrams for deeper insight.

## Troubleshooting

- If the calculation fails, check network connectivity and ensure the backend API is reachable.
